There's a sentence from Rick Rubin's _The Creative Act_ that has stayed with me ever since I heard it: "**Listening is suspending disbelief.**"

I was out for a run, listening to the audiobook, when I heard that phrase and stopped to write it down. In the book, Rubin discusses this idea in the context of conversation. He explains that if we spend the time while someone else is speaking being critical or judgmental, we block true communication. Not only do we fail to connect, but we also rob ourselves of the chance to learn something new.

I couldn’t agree more. This mindset, or lack of it, explains so much of the polarization and animosity that define our world today. Too often, we don’t really listen—we're just waiting for our turn to speak, or worse, to argue. Conversations become battles, where the goal isn’t understanding but "winning." And in the process, we lose sight of the possibility of finding common ground, growing, or even changing our perspective. So we stop listening.
But there's a deeper meaning behind "**Listening is suspending disbelief.**" I *believe* that music and sound are not just ways of understanding the world and ourselves—they are also pathways to experiences that cannot be captured in words or represented visually. Because music and sound are - or *can be* - so abstract, they transcend the limitations of language. At the same time, they are deeply personal and subjective, inviting us to connect with our inner selves by anchoring us in the present moment and engaging our emotions.

When we truly listen, even for a moment, we set aside logic, reason, and self-focus. That analytical process might come later, as we reflect on what we've heard. In the act of listening itself, though, we open ourselves to something deeper. In that sense, **listening is believing** —a way of touching an unspoken truth about the world.

I truly believe the world would be a better place if we all listened more—and listened better. I also find myself missing the internet of fifteen years ago. It wasn’t perfect, but there was a stronger sense of community and more opportunities for meaningful conversations, before everything became so polarized and commoditized. I don’t have a solution for that, but I’ve realized I’ve been holding back from public discourse in the meantime—focusing instead on making music, teaching, developing software, and creating instruments. For years, I’ve wanted to share my thoughts on music, sound, technology, and more, but struggled to find the right medium, while also suffering from imposter syndrome. Recently, I decided it’s time to move forward.

That’s why I’m starting _Amplified Silence_, a monthly newsletter dedicated to exploring sound and listening. Each month, I’ll share a new article or essay about music or sound, along with recommendations for albums, pieces, books, or other media. I’ll also keep you up to date on my work and upcoming projects. My goal is to create a space for thoughtful conversation and to share ideas that might inspire or resonate with others.

I’ll be publishing _Amplified Silence_ on Substack, and you can sign up below—it’s completely free, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. The first issue will be released on **January 15, 2025**.

Looking forward to connecting with you then.

Best regards,  
Óscar
